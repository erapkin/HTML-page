				<h1 id="building a bag">Building a Bag</h1>
				<p>When a new player first gets seriously interested in disc golf, the temptation to try every disc out there is difficult to resist. It can be extremely confusing determining which discs are appropriate for your skill level and throwing style, and you will often hear conflicting advice based on other players preferences and biases. The discs you need for a well rounded bag can be divided into different categories. The general concept is building a bag made of different speed levels of fairly straight and controllable discs, with overstable and understable utility discs for more specialized shots. The categories, in order of relative importance, are as follows:</p>
				<p><b>Putter</b> - This is by far the most important disc in your bag. First you need to select a putting mold that is comfortable for your hand and putting style that you can control easily and confidently use to putt in any typical situation. Second, you will need a putter mold that you can use for approach shots and control drives. You can use the same mold for both roles, or select a putting putter mold and a driving / approach putter mold. Do not neglect finding a putter you are comfortable driving with because no other category of discs offer the control, accuracy and glide that putters do. Putters are easy to put on a dead straight line, and have the least amount of skip when they land compared to other disc types, making them exceptional for placement shots. Many players make the mistake of throwing nothing but midranges for shorter approach shots they could reach with more accuracy by throwing a putter. Do not let their name confuse you, "putters" were once the distance drivers in their day and skilled players can throw them as far as 400 feet. Some of the more popular stable putter molds are MVP Ions, Gateway Wizards, Discraft Challengers & Magnets, and Innova Aviars. All of these make excellent discs for everything from 15' putts to 300' drives, and should be the beginning disc golfers main learning tool for developing form. As advised in the putting section, buying multiple putters is highly recommend. It's a good idea to select one putter for your putting putter, and designate other putters you carry as driving putters, so you don't risk losing or damaging the disc you are familiar putting with. </p>
				<p><b>Midrange</b> - The midrange is an extremely important disc and you need to find a disc that you can throw with accuracy and confidence. It's very likely you will want multiple midrange molds to cover different shots, but in general there isn't a need to have more than 3 different midrange molds. You can select a straight, stable mold for the majority of your midrange shots, and an understable mold for turn-over shots, tailwinds or stand-still approaches. You can also choose to carry an overstable midrange, but this role can be covered by powering down on an overstable driver as well. What you should look for in a midrange mold is a disc that will fly with control and consistency for you on long approaches and medium range, controlled drives. If you can learn to effectively use midranges off the tee, they will give you greater control than drivers offer. When deciding whether to use a midrange or putter on an approach or drive, consider that midranges will generally resist the wind better and fly lower lines better than the slower putter molds can, as well as offering greater distance potential. Some popular stable midranges are Innova Rocs, Millennium MS, Discraft Buzz, MVP Axis and the Latitude 64 Core. Some popular understable midranges are the Innova Stingray, Discraft Meteor, Latitude 64 Fuse and Gateway Element. Some popular overstable midranges are the Innova Gator, MVP Vector, Discraft Drone and Gateway Warrior.</p>
				<p><b>Control Driver</b> - The control driver is the fastest disc that beginning disc golfers should include in their bag. These generally include discs in the speed range of 5-7 going by Innova's scale, though more advanced players sometimes utilize faster molds like OLF's and Strikers for this role. Control drivers will be useful for players of all skill levels. For beginners they will offer maximum distance potential without being too fast or overstable to control. For advanced players they will offer more precision and less fade than higher speed drivers. Control drivers will penetrate wind better than putters or midranges and offer greater distance. Some popular control driver molds are the Innova Teebird, Eagle, Gazelle and Leopard, Discraft Cyclone, Millennium JLS and Latitude 64 River. </p>
				<p><b>Distance Driver</b> - The distance driver, while it has a certain appeal due to it's maximum distance potential, is the least important disc in the bag of a disc golfer. For beginners, they are often too much to handle and will cause more harm than good trying to throw them. For advanced players, there will rarely be situations where you need to reach for a maximum distance disc, since putters, mids and control drivers can effectively cover the distances most disc golf holes cover. The two most common uses for distance drivers are long, open holes where distance is more important than accuracy, and flying low lines. Faster discs have the ability to fly low lines better than slow discs and maximum distance discs epitomize this advantage by being capable of flying over 400' with 10' of height. Popular maximum distance drivers are the Innova Destroyer, Boss & Katana, the Discraft Nuke, the Millennium Quasar and the Latitude 64 Halo. There are also many discs that fall in between maximum distance drivers and control drivers, such as the Millennium OLF, Innova Orc & Valkyrie, Discmania PD & DD and Discraft Avengers & Surges. Once you have developed the ability to utilize these faster discs, having discs from this sub-category will be useful in giving you more options to approach a given hole. </p>

				<h1 id="disc utilization">Utilizing your discs</h1>
				<p>In addition to these recommendations, here are some general suggestions for properly utilizing your discs:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It is best to carry the least amount of molds needed to cover your full array of shots. By keeping the mold count down to a minimum you will be able to learn the behavior of your discs quicker than if you carried a wider assortment of discs. Using this method you will also be able to break in the discs you use so that you can cover different shots with the same mold. It will also be more cost effective in the long run because you will want multiples of your most frequently used discs for field practice and in case you lose them, and it's easier to buy back-ups of 5-8 molds than it is, say, 12-15.</li>
					<li>Learn how far you can throw each disc in your bag confidently. Take your whole setup out to an open field and find a way to record relative distances thrown (Google Earth, football field lines etc.). Many players only throw drivers off the tee and do themselves a disservice by not utilizing the slower, more accurate discs they have in their bag for these shots. Learning to throw putters and midranges off the tee will offer you an advantage over players who do not.</li>
					<li>Experiment with different release angles to achieve different flight lines. Once you have developed your form enough to consistently throw your disc flat and aim it where you want, you then want to teach yourself how to throw a on a variety of hyzer and anhyzer angles. By doing so you become less reliant on your discs to fly your lines and can manipulate any disc in your bag to fly any line you want for the most part. If you do not develop the ability to throw hyzer and anhyzer throws you will be significantly limiting the number of possible lines you can hit with every disc in your bag, you will limit your ability to fight different wind conditions, and you will be at the mercy of the stability your disc has rather than being able to control it. This is an extremely important part to becoming a skilled player and should never be neglected.</li>
					<li>You can reduce the number of different molds you carry by throwing different plastics, weights and stages of wear of the same mold. One popular example of this is the Innova Roc, which can cover all of your midrange needs. You can carry a brand new KC Pro Roc at max weight for wind fighting and more overstable duties, broken in Rocs for a straight flight, and heavily worn Rocs for a turnover mid. Through personal experience you will learn which roles can be filled by discs in different stages of wear, and which categories need to be supplemented by additional molds of varying stabilities. In general it's easier to cover various stabilities with slower molds, because these discs will be used more often and therefore beat in quicker, and are more readily available in baseline plastics.</li>
