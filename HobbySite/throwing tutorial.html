				<h3 id="The Grip">The Grip</h3>
				<p>First and foremost, you need to use a &#8220;power grip&#8221;. In the power grip, your index finger is under the rim of the disc and your thumb on top. Resting the index finger on the outside of the rim is called a &#8220;control grip&#8221;. This grip will take away at least a quarter of the power from your throw, which is just fine for upshots or short drives but we want maximum distance off the tee pad in most cases. It might feel uncomfortable at first but stick with it. The results will speak for themselves. You should grip the disc as tightly as possible. (note: there is gripping it TOO hard. You can easily determine this by flexing your wrist up or to the top side of your forearm. If you can&#8217;t freely move your wrist in this fashion then you should ease off on your grip until you can. Another way to do this is wait until your disc is coming forward to tighten your grip) Many times on the course I&#8217;ve heard an adage that makes this easier to remember. The harder you grip, the farther you rip.</p>
				<h3 id="The Stance">The Stance</h3>
				<p>Although there are many very good players I know that go for the gusto and teach beginners to drive with a backhand using a full run up, I prefer to teach new players the Backhand from a balanced, stationary stance. This technique is already frustrating enough to learn without the added difficulties of running or stepping into the throw. I truly believe that it is incredibly beneficial in the long run for those new to the backhand to learn the basics first, then add the run up later on when you&#8217;re comfortable using the Backhand. This will not only simplify the entire process but I strongly feel it also builds confidence due to the increase in accuracy that is gained by remaining stationary and you can apply this to upshots and shorter or tighter drives where the extra accuracy is preferable to distance. So, that said, line up your shot. Start aiming your shot by pointing the shoulder on your throwing arm at a spot on the fairway where you want the disc to start its fade or turn, which can be tricky at times depending on many factors including disc stability, wind and elevation. Becoming more familiar with the disc makes this much easier. For simplicity, I&#8217;ll refer to the point where the disc begins to turn as the target. Relax your knees and set your feet at a little past shoulder width. Make sure to stay balanced. You should now be facing 90 degrees from your target. </p>
				<h3 id="The Pull Back">The Pull Back</h3>
				<p>Keep in mind that it is crucial that you maintain balance through-out your entire throw. Balance is the key to achieving consistency and accuracy on each and every throw. Also, if you watch the pros play, they are all very smooth. Try to emulate this and avoid being herky-jerky and sloppy to further add to your consistency and accuracy. This is a fun game regardless, but lower scores increase that enjoyment! Keeping your arm straight, bring the disc back to about shoulder or chest height, stretching back as far as possible without losing your balance. Keep your non-throwing arm away from the body. I tend to bring mine back with the disc, allowing me to stretch further. This allows for better balance and keeps that pesky thing from interfering with your throw. Also, it is crucial that you allow your head and shoulders to turn almost completely away or a 180 degrees from the target. Despite our natural tendencies, the arm/disc merely follow our hips and shoulders to generate the snap needed to make the disc fly. At this point, your weight should also be shifted almost completely to your back foot to generate more power when you transfer your weight back to your front foot on the follow through or release."</p>
